    <h3>About Paneer Sabzi</h3>
    <p> 
        Simple paneer sabji made with soft paneer cubes cooked in basic onion tomato masala and minimum spices.<br> 
        If you are a regular reader of my blog you should be knowing that my family is full of paneer lovers<br>
        and I end up making at least one variety of paneer recipe atleast in a week.
